I am a first year PhD student at the University of Warwick, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Igor Carboni Oliveira](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~igorcarb/). Previously I was an undergraduate student at [Turing Class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm), Peking University.

I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science, especially in computational complexity. Currently I am focusing on metacomplexity and its connection to pseudorandomness, circuit lower bounds, etc.
